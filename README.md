# Go-Game

This project will guide you through the process of creating a real
application with graphical user interface. For that, we will implement
a Japanese board game called Go. Although Go has quite easy rules and
graphics, it shows you all the key parts that are used for more complex
graphics, such as animated games or simulations.
